// contains a class called Geocoder
// can be instantiated as is - optionally it's 'driver' can be changed
  // default driver will be loaded from the config.json
  // current default driver is mapbox
// creates a new instance of the driver, and calls the driver.geocode method
// the methods called in this class essentially define the public interface for geocoder drivers
